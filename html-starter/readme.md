# HTML starter sheet.

The purpose of this project is to provide a list of most HTML elements for styling purposes.

## ToDo

### check your `<head>`

look into implementing [Manuel Matuzovic's](https://www.matuzo.at/) [html boilerplate](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/)

### Dialog element

The `dialogue` element was omitted until some javasript is added to open and close it.

```(HTML)
<dialog open>
  <p>I'm an alert!</p>
</dialog>
```

### add support for darkmode

There are [different ways to set up darkmode](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/). Initially, build this with a media query `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {}`

### Check for any missing html elements
